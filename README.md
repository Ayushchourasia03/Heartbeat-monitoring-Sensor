# Heartbeat-monitoring-Sensor
This Arduino code uses a Pulse Sensor and I2C LCD display to monitor and show heart rate. It reads the pulse sensor data, calculates the BPM, and displays it along with a custom heart icon on the LCD. The system also sends the raw signal and BPM values to the Serial Monitor for debugging.
